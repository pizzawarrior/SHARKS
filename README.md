# SHARKS


An ongoing exploration of shark attacks (encounters/ incidents) from 1959- 2018. The focus is primarily on California, and how the state compares to other high risk areas around the globe. 

Using the Global Shark Attack File I was able to address specific questions I have about the occurrence of shark attacks in California. These questions are:

* Are shark encounters increasing or decreasing?
* Where are the places with the highest rate of encounters?
* How does population play a role in reports of shark encounters?
* How does seasonality play a role in encounters?
* Is Northern California, especially the Red Triangle really that much more dangerous than the rest of California?
